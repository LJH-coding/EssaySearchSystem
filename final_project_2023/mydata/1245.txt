Invariants of Welded Virtual Knots Via Crossed Module Invariants of  Knotted Surfaces  We define an invariant of welded virtual knots from each finite crossed
module by considering crossed module invariants of ribbon knotted surfaces
which are naturally associated with them. We elucidate that the invariants
obtained are non trivial by calculating explicit examples. We define welded
virtual graphs and consider invariants of them defined in a similar way.
